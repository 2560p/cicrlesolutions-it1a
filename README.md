# circle solutions website
the website source is located in `src/` folder.
root files include docker things (to have the project running on every system easily), `.gitignore` (for the macos' `.DS_Store`), and this file.
## running
to run the code, open Command Prompt application and `dokcer-compose up` while in the root directory of this project (`src/` folder is visible). the port 80 will be exposed and accessible via the browser (http://localhost:80)
*however the server as of now does not have any php code to run, so it might be beneficial up to a point to open the `src/` folder's index file*
