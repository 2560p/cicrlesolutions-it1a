# circle solutions website
the website sources are located in `src/` folder.

root files also include docker files (to have the project running on every system easily), `.gitignore` (for the macos' `.DS_Store`, config files not to get changed by a mistake), and this file (readme).

## running
to set up a php server, open Command Prompt and run `dokcer-compose up` while in the root directory of this project (make sure `src/` folder is visible). the port 80 will be exposed and accessible via the browser (http://localhost:80)

*however the server as of now does not have any php code to run, so it might be beneficial up to a point just to open the `src/` folder's index file*

## structure
```yet to be defined```
